# About the project 
This project is that on the main page is a bookshelf that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently readding or want to read. The other page is a search page to find other books to add to your bookshelf. If any of the books as a result of your search already exists on your bookshelf, their data will be synced. That way you know what books are already in your shelf.
